# Pug Smile School
Implement a Design With Bootstrap


### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpage, including custom styles and Bootstrap integration.
- **Bootstrap 4.4.1**: For responsive design and components like the navbar and carousel.
- **Google Fonts**: To enhance the typography with fonts like Source Sans Pro and Coiny.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `homepage.html` file in your web browser to view the Pug Smile School Homepage.
3. Ensure you have an internet connection to load external dependencies such as Bootstrap and Google Fonts.

## Header/Hero Section

The header/hero section includes the following elements:
- **Logo Section**: Displays the Smileschool logo along with a smiley face icon.
- **Navigation Bar**: Contains links to different sections of the site, including "Courses," "Pricing," and "Love."
- **Hero Content**: Features a prominent heading "Get Puggy" and emphasizes words like "STUMPY," "BARK," and "LOYAL" to describe the playful nature of pugs. A call-to-action button "REGISTER FOR FREE" is also included.
- **Pro Pugs Section**: Showcases notable pugs with their achievements and titles.

## Carousel of Quotes

The carousel of quotes section highlights testimonials from various pugs. This section uses the Bootstrap Carousel component to display rotating quotes, accompanied by images of the pugs who provided the testimonials. Each slide includes:
- **Pug Image**: A rounded-circle image of the pug providing the testimonial.
- **Quote**: A blockquote with the pug's testimonial.
- **Author Information**: The name and playful occupation of the pug.
