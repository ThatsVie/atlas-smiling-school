## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Bootstrap customization.
- **Bootstrap 4.4.1**: For responsive design and interactive components.
- **JavaScript** & **jQuery**: For enhanced interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts.
- **Figma**: For design reference and layout guidance.

## Project Structure

This project includes the following key files:
- `index.html`, `pricing.html`, `courses.html`, `love.html`

- `scripts.js` for JavaScript functionalities

## Challenges and Reflections

Creating a visually cohesive and accessible layout based on Figma designs required careful attention to detail. Implementing Bootstrap’s responsive grid system posed challenges when adapting components to different screen sizes, but it also reinforced my understanding of CSS media queries and responsive design.
